# Greasy Justice

Aliens with limited brain space are invading! They want your burger (or your life…). Their strategy is to overrun you, limiting your (physical) space, don’t let them!

It’s a real-time turn-based action shooter game. Survive as long as possible to get the highest score.

Controls: Mouse + 1/2/3 shortcuts for rerolling action symbols
